# 🌾 Farm-D-Care

Farm-D-Care is a Flutter-based mobile app that helps farmers detect diseases in crops like **potato** and **tomato** by scanning affected leaves through the phone camera. It uses Firebase for authentication and Cloudinary for storing scanned images. The app provides users with information, remedies, and videos to manage diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight effectively.
